    // Configuration specific to the PiperTTS Engine Interface

    // The application needs to have at least 1 configured endpoint if voice narration is enabled.
    // If voice narration is disabled, then this endpoint configuration does not apply and is ignored.
    // Multiple endpoint types and targets may be configured. The application will try to contact the
    // endpoint with "order = 1" first, then try subsequent endpoints with a higher order.
    // Setting an endpoint order to 0 disables that endpoint.

    // For each endpoint there are three values that must be set as follows:
    // order: 0, or 1-9
    //      0= endpoint is disabled and is ignored.
    //      1= primary endpoint to be used for voice narration (if enabled)
    //      2-9= secondary fallback endpoint(s) to be tried if the primary endpoint is unreachable.
    // type: either "Server" or "Client". 
    //      Server = Application is running on a webserver and the webserver contacts the PiperTTS endpoint on behalf of the user's web browser.
    //      Client = User's web browser contacts the PiperTTS endpoint directly. 
    //      For performance and long-term availability, a local webserver that can query a local PiperTTS server instance is preferred.
    //      however, there may be situations, like with the demo website, where this is not possible.
    // url: the URL of the PiperTTS web server. 
    //      If type="Server" then this URL need to be reachable from the application webserver.
    //      If type="Client" then this URL needs to be reachable from the client's web browser.
    //      A simple diagnostic test is to try to reach the url/voices with a browser on the corresponding source. A list of available
    //      narration voices should be returned if the PiperTTS server is reachable.
